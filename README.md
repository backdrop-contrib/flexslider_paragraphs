# Flexslider Paragraphs

Flexslider Paragraphs provides a field display formatter for Paragraphs fields,
which renders the Paragraphs items in a Flexslider.

A typical use case could be a nested Paragraphs field. The parent Paragraph type
would be _Slider_ and the child would be _Slide_. (_Slider_ would be a
multivalued Paragraphs field that only allows _Slide_ Paragraph types to be
inserted).  If the display setting for the _Slider_ Paragraph field is set to
"Flexslider Paragraphs" then each child _Slide_ item will be rendered in a
Flexslider.

The display settings will allow you to select a Flexslider option set.

Depending on what you include in the _Slide_ paragraph type, you may need to do
some CSS styling to get it to display appropriately.
